			<Text>[COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Source: Civilization IV - Civilopedia entry[ENDCOLOR][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]A ger is a portable, bent dwelling structure traditionally used by nomads in the steppes of Central Asia as their home. The structure comprises a crown or compression wheel, usually steam bent, supported by roof ribs which are bent down at the end where they meet the lattice wall (again, steam bent). The top of the wall is prevented from spreading by means of a tension band which opposes the force of the roof ribs. The structure is usually covered by layers of fabric and sheep's wool felt for insulation and weatherproofing.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As nomadic tribesmen (and later as cavalry-based conquerors), the Mongolians' survival was dependent upon the quality of their horses and the skill of their riders. A warhorse must be extensively trained if it is to be successfully used in battle. In their natural state, most horses quite sensibly seek to run away from dangerous situations - say, when surrounded by screaming men armed with sharp objects. A cavalryman's horse, on the other hand, needs to be able to suppress this instinct and instead instantly carry out any order given it by its rider - no matter how suicidal. Such training takes time and skill - for both mount and rider.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][COLOR_POSITIVE_TEXT]Credits: 3UC Project - wodhann, mikeburnfire[ENDCOLOR]</Text>
