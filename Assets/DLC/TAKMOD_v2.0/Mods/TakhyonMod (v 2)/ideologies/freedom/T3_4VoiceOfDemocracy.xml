			<Text>"Voice of Democracy" refers to a phrase "Arsenal of Democracy", which was coined by President Franklin Roosevelt during a radio broadcast in December 1940 to describe America's role in the struggle against totalitarianism. The unofficial policy of the United States during World War II and the ensuing Cold War against Communism, the "Arsenal" refers to committing a nation's private industry to producing military materials for the nation and other nations with the goal of defeating a common enemy. The privately-owned manufacturers are compensated at market value, usually on a "cash-and-carry" basis.</Text>
