			<Text>The Helicopter Gunship is a deadly Air Unit, which can hover over all terrain types including mountains, and it can cross oceans without having to embark. Helicopter Gunships receive a hefty combat bonus when fighting tanks. However, as an Air Unit, it cannot capture Cities or pillage tiles. It's a highly mobile Unit with a lot of Movement and it also receives additional Sight, making it very useful as a recon Unit in the late game. Use it for fighting against tanks and for gaining extra visibility in the battlefield.</Text>
