	<!-- African Forest Elephant gets Altitude Training Kilimanjaro promo (I wanted this to be ingore terrain cost on hills, but that's more difficult to do)... -->
	<!-- Making a completely different promotion which would only give the movement bonus from Kilimanjaro would also allow the unit to possibly get both that AND the Kilimanjaro movement bonus, which would be totally bonkers. -->

			<Text>The African Forest Elephant is a Carthaginian unique unit which can move after attacking, replacing the Horseman. The Carthaginian Elephants are more powerful than the Horseman but have less movement points. However, the Altitude Training promotion they receive means that African Forest Elephants have double movement and extra [ICON_STRENGTH] Combat Strength on hills. They also receive offensive bonuses when attacking into a lower elevation tile from hills, and strike fear into nearby enemy units, giving them all a negative combat modifier. Use them to quickly advance through higher elevation terrain and attack into opponents in hills. Success in combat with an Elephant has an increased chance of generating Great Generals.</Text>
